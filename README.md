# Hotel Reservation System using Random Forest Classifier

Welcome to the Hotel Reservation System repository! This project showcases the implementation of a hotel reservation system using the Random Forest classifier. The goal of this project is to predict hotel room reservations and optimize the booking process by leveraging the power of machine learning and data science.

## Project Overview

In the modern hospitality industry, efficiently managing hotel reservations is crucial for providing an exceptional guest experience. This project aims to predict reservation patterns and enhance decision-making for hotels through the utilization of the Random Forest algorithm. By analyzing historical booking data, guest preferences, and other relevant features, we create a predictive model that assists hotels in maximizing occupancy rates and improving resource allocation.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

- **Feature Selection:** Identify the most relevant features for training the Random Forest model.

- **Random Forest Model:** Implement the Random Forest classifier to predict hotel room reservations.

- **Model Evaluation:** Assess the performance of the Random Forest model using appropriate evaluation metrics.

- **Prediction and Optimization:** Utilize the trained model to predict reservation demand and optimize resource allocation.

## Prerequisites

- Python (version 3.11)
- Jupyter Notebook
